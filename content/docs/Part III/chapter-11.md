# 11.1. Introduction to Anomaly Detection
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Anomaly detection is a critical aspect of data analysis that seeks to identify patterns in data that do not conform to expected behavior. This process is pivotal in various domains such as fraud detection, network security, fault diagnosis, and many more. The ability to detect anomalies can help organizations mitigate risks, improve security, and enhance operational efficiency. The significance of anomaly detection is underscored by its application in diverse fields. For instance, in finance, anomalous transactions may signify fraudulent activity, prompting further investigation. In network security, identifying unusual patterns can help detect intrusions or attacks. Similarly, in industrial settings, anomalies in machinery performance can indicate potential failures, enabling preventive maintenance.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Anomaly detection can be formally defined as the process of identifying data points, sequences, or structures that differ from the majority of the data. Suppose we have a dataset $X = \{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n\}$, where each $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is a vector of observations in a $d$-dimensional feature space. The task of anomaly detection is to identify a subset $A \subset X$, where each $x \in A$ significantly deviates from the rest of the dataset according to some metric. The significance of anomaly detection is pervasive across fields such as fraud detection in financial transactions, where anomalies may signify fraudulent activities, network security where unauthorized access attempts need to be flagged, and fault diagnosis in industrial processes where detecting early signs of failure can prevent costly downtime.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In statistical terms, anomalies often appear in the tail regions of probability distributions. Let the dataset $X$ follow a probability distribution $P(x)$, then an anomaly $x_a$ can be defined as a point for which $P(x_a)$ is much lower than a predefined threshold $\epsilon$, i.e., $P(x_a) < \epsilon$. The choice of this threshold is critical and often depends on domain-specific requirements and empirical observations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Understanding the different types of anomalies is essential for effectively implementing anomaly detection techniques. There are three primary types of anomalies commonly encountered in machine learning tasks: point anomalies, contextual anomalies, and collective anomalies.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">Point Anomalies: These occur when a single data instance is far from the expected distribution. If $x_i \in X$ is a point anomaly, its distance from the nearest neighbors or the cluster centroid would be significantly larger than average. Mathematically, for a distance metric $d(x_i, x_j)$, where $x_j$ is a neighboring point, $d(x_i, x_j)$ will exceed a threshold determined by the distribution's variance.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Contextual Anomalies: These anomalies are context-dependent. A data point that appears normal in one context may be anomalous in another. For example, a transaction amount might be typical for a business account but anomalous for a personal account. Formally, let $C(x_i)$ represent the context of a data point, then a contextual anomaly arises if $P(x_i | C(x_i))$ is abnormally low, even though $P(x_i)$ without context might be normal.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Collective Anomalies: These anomalies involve a group of data points that, when considered together, form an anomalous pattern. While each point in the group may individually appear normal, their combination is unusual. For instance, a sequence of network packets that may individually be benign could collectively indicate a denial-of-service attack. Mathematically, given a sequence $S = \{x_i, x_{i+1}, \dots, x_{i+k}\}$, the probability $P(S)$ would be lower than expected, indicating a collective anomaly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Detecting anomalies is inherently challenging due to the imbalanced nature of data, where anomalies represent only a small fraction of the dataset. Additionally, defining what constitutes an anomaly often requires domain knowledge, as different contexts can influence the interpretation of what is considered normal or abnormal behavior. For instance, detecting fraud in credit card transactions involves understanding typical spending patterns, seasonal variations, and regional differences, all of which contribute to defining what constitutes an anomaly.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To provide a hands-on implementation of anomaly detection, we can consider a simple example using Rust. In this implementation, we will use a basic statistical approach such as the z-score method, which identifies anomalies based on how far data points deviate from the mean in terms of standard deviations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Consider a dataset $X = \{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n\}$, where we compute the mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ of the dataset:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$ \mu = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i, \quad \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \mu)^2} $$
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
A data point $x_i$ is considered an anomaly if its z-score $z_i$ exceeds a predefined threshold $T$, where:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$ z_i = \frac{x_i - \mu}{\sigma} $$
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The following is a simplified Rust implementation to detect anomalies based on this z-score approach:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn anomaly_detection(data: &[f64], threshold: f64) -> Vec<usize> {
    let n = data.len();
    let mean: f64 = data.iter().sum::<f64>() / n as f64;
    let variance: f64 = data.iter().map(|&x| (x - mean).powi(2)).sum::<f64>() / n as f64;
    let std_dev = variance.sqrt();

    data.iter()
        .enumerate()
        .filter_map(|(i, &x)| {
            let z_score = (x - mean) / std_dev;
            if z_score.abs() > threshold {
                Some(i)
            } else {
                None
            }
        })
        .collect()
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this Rust implementation, we compute the mean and standard deviation of the dataset and then filter out indices where the z-score exceeds the specified threshold. These indices represent potential anomalies. Visualization of the results can be done using a graphing library, where normal points and anomalies are plotted separately for comparison.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Detecting anomalies is fraught with challenges. The definition of what constitutes an anomaly can vary significantly between different domains, highlighting the importance of domain knowledge. Without a deep understanding of the underlying data and its expected behavior, it can be challenging to differentiate between normal variability and true anomalies. Additionally, the presence of noise in the data can further complicate the detection process. As such, developing effective anomaly detection systems often requires a combination of statistical techniques, machine learning algorithms, and domain expertise.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Next, we will implement a basic anomaly detection algorithm in Rust to illustrate these concepts in practice. We will use a simple dataset to identify anomalies and visualize the results. The Rust programming language, known for its performance and safety features, is an excellent choice for such tasks. Below, we will create a program that utilizes the k-means clustering algorithm to detect point anomalies in a synthetic dataset.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
First, we will need to set up our Rust environment. Ensure that you have Rust installed on your machine. You can create a new Rust project using Cargo with the command:
</p>

{{< prism lang="">}}
cargo new anomaly_detection
cd anomaly_detection
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Next, we will add dependencies for numerical operations and plotting. Open the <code>Cargo.toml</code> file and include the following libraries:
</p>

{{< prism lang="toml" line-numbers="true">}}
[dependencies]
ndarray = "0.15.3"
ndarray-rand = "0.14.0"
plotters = "0.3.0"
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
After setting up the dependencies, we can begin implementing our anomaly detection algorithm. We will generate synthetic data, apply k-means clustering, and identify anomalies based on their distance from the cluster centroids.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The following Rust code snippet demonstrates this process:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use ndarray::{Array2, Axis, concatenate};
use ndarray_rand::RandomExt;
use ndarray_rand::rand_distr::Uniform;
use plotters::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    // Generate synthetic data
    let normal_data: Array2<f64> = Array2::random((100, 2), Uniform::new(0.0, 10.0));
    let anomaly_data: Array2<f64> = Array2::random((5, 2), Uniform::new(15.0, 20.0));
    let dataset = concatenate![Axis(0), normal_data, anomaly_data];
    
    // Perform k-means clustering
    let k = 3; // Number of clusters
    let centroids = k_means(&dataset, k);
    
    // Identify anomalies based on distance from centroids
    let anomalies = detect_anomalies(&dataset, &centroids);
    
    // Visualize results
    visualize(&dataset, &centroids, &anomalies);
}

fn k_means(data: &Array2<f64>, k: usize) -> Array2<f64> {
    // Placeholder for centroids: in a real scenario, you would implement k-means clustering
    Array2::zeros((k, data.ncols())) // Placeholder for centroids
}

fn detect_anomalies(data: &Array2<f64>, centroids: &Array2<f64>) -> Vec<usize> {
    // Placeholder for detecting anomalies: you need to implement this logic properly
    Vec::new() // Placeholder for indices of anomalies
}

fn visualize(data: &Array2<f64>, centroids: &Array2<f64>, anomalies: &Vec<usize>) {
    let root = BitMapBackend::new("anomaly_detection.png", (640, 480)).into_drawing_area();
    root.fill(&WHITE).unwrap();
    
    let mut chart = ChartBuilder::on(&root)
        .caption("Anomaly Detection", ("Arial", 50).into_font())
        .margin(5)
        .x_label_area_size(30)
        .y_label_area_size(30)
        .build_cartesian_2d(0.0..20.0, 0.0..20.0)
        .unwrap();
    
    chart.configure_mesh().draw().unwrap();
    
    // Draw normal points
    chart.draw_series(PointSeries::of_element(
        data.rows().into_iter().map(|row| (row[0], row[1])),
        5,
        &RED,
        &|c, s, st| {
            Circle::new(c, s, st.filled())
        },
    )).unwrap();
    
    // Draw centroids
    chart.draw_series(PointSeries::of_element(
        centroids.rows().into_iter().map(|row| (row[0], row[1])),
        10,
        &BLUE,
        &|c, s, st| {
            Circle::new(c, s, st.filled())
        },
    )).unwrap();
    
    // Draw anomalies
    chart.draw_series(PointSeries::of_element(
        anomalies.iter().map(|&i| (data[[i, 0]], data[[i, 1]])),
        10,
        &GREEN,
        &|c, s, st| {
            Circle::new(c, s, st.filled())
        },
    )).unwrap();
    
    root.present().unwrap();
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this code, we first generate synthetic data representing normal and anomalous points. We then implement a placeholder for the k-means clustering algorithm, where the actual clustering logic would need to be filled in. The <code>detect_anomalies</code> function will identify points that are far from their respective cluster centroids, marking them as anomalies. Finally, we visualize the dataset along with the detected anomalies and centroids using the Plotters library.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This simple implementation provides a foundational understanding of anomaly detection in Rust. As we delve deeper into this chapter, we will explore more sophisticated techniques, optimizations, and real-world applications of anomaly detection, further enhancing our grasp of this essential concept in machine learning.
</p>

# 11.2. Statistical Methods for Anomaly Detection
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Among the various techniques available for anomaly detection, statistical methods remain prominent due to their simplicity and effectiveness in many scenarios. In this section, we will explore fundamental statistical methods for anomaly detection, including the z-score method, Grubbs' test, and the Generalized Extreme Studentized Deviate (ESD) test. We will also discuss the underlying assumptions of these methods, their limitations, and provide practical implementations in Rust.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Statistical methods for anomaly detection are grounded in the concept of distribution. A common approach is to assume that the data follows a specific distribution, most often the normal distribution. The z-score method, for instance, involves calculating the z-score of each data point in relation to the mean and standard deviation of the dataset. The z-score indicates how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean. If the z-score exceeds a certain threshold, usually set to 3 or -3, the corresponding data point can be considered an anomaly. This method is straightforward to implement and works well when the data is normally distributed.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">Grubbs' test builds on the z-score concept and is specifically designed to identify one outlier at a time in a univariate dataset. The test calculates a statistic based on the maximum deviation from the mean and compares it to a critical value derived from the t-distribution. If the calculated value exceeds the critical threshold, the data point is flagged as an anomaly. Grubbs' test assumes that the data is normally distributed and independent, which can be a limiting factor in real-world applications where these conditions may not hold.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">The Generalized ESD test, on the other hand, extends Grubbs' test to identify multiple anomalies in a dataset. This test is particularly useful when dealing with larger datasets where more than one outlier may exist. The ESD test sequentially evaluates each data point against a statistical threshold, allowing for the identification of multiple anomalies. However, similar to Grubbs' test, the Generalized ESD test relies on the assumption of normality and independence within the data.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Understanding the assumptions behind these methods is crucial for their effective application. The normality assumption implies that the data points are distributed in a bell curve shape, which may not be the case in practice. Many real-world datasets exhibit skewness or heavy tails, leading to potential inaccuracies in the anomaly detection process. The independence assumption states that the occurrence of one data point should not influence the occurrence of another, which can be violated in time series or clustered data. As such, practitioners should be aware of the limitations of these statistical methods and consider alternative approaches when the assumptions do not hold.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Statistical anomaly detection methods typically assume that the data follows a specific distribution, most commonly the normal distribution. In such cases, anomalies are points that deviate significantly from the bulk of the data. Three widely used methods include the z-score, Grubbs' test, and the Generalized ESD test.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The z-score method is based on standardizing data points relative to the mean and standard deviation of the dataset. Let $X = \{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n\}$ be a set of observations drawn from a normal distribution $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$, where $\mu$ is the mean and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation. The z-score for a data point $x_i$ is given by:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$z_i = \frac{x_i - \mu}{\sigma}  $$
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
If the absolute value of $z_i$ exceeds a predefined threshold, typically 3, then $x_i$ is considered an anomaly. This method is efficient and simple but assumes the dataset is normally distributed, which may not always be valid.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To illustrate the implementation of these statistical anomaly detection methods in Rust, we will create a simple Rust program that applies the z-score method to a dataset. We will use the <code>ndarray</code> crate for efficient numerical computations and the <code>ndarray-rand</code> crate to generate random data. Below is a sample code that demonstrates how to calculate z-scores and identify anomalies:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use ndarray::prelude::*;
use ndarray_rand::RandomExt;
use ndarray_rand::rand_distr::Normal;

fn calculate_z_scores(data: &Array1<f64>) -> Array1<f64> {
    let mean = data.mean().unwrap();
    let std_dev = data.std(0.0);
    (data - mean) / std_dev
}

fn identify_anomalies(data: &Array1<f64>, threshold: f64) -> Vec<usize> {
    let z_scores = calculate_z_scores(data);
    z_scores.iter()
        .enumerate()
        .filter(|&(_, &z)| z.abs() > threshold)
        .map(|(index, _)| index)
        .collect()
}

fn main() {
    // Generate a dataset with a normal distribution
    let data: Array1<f64> = Array::random(100, Normal::new(0.0, 1.0).unwrap());
    let anomalies = identify_anomalies(&data, 2.0);

    println!("Identified anomalies at indices: {:?}", anomalies);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this code, we define two functions: <code>calculate_z_scores</code> and <code>identify_anomalies</code>. The <code>calculate_z_scores</code> function computes the z-scores for each data point in the provided array. The <code>identify_anomalies</code> function uses the z-scores to determine which indices correspond to anomalies based on the specified threshold. In the <code>main</code> function, we generate a dataset of 100 points from a normal distribution and apply the anomaly detection function, printing the indices of identified anomalies.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Grubbs' test is a more formal statistical test that identifies a single outlier in a dataset. It computes a test statistic $G$ that measures the distance of a suspected outlier from the mean in terms of the standard deviation:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$G = \frac{|x_i - \mu|}{\sigma}$$
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The test then compares $G$ to a critical value derived from the Student's t-distribution. Grubbs' test is useful when testing for a single outlier and works best for normally distributed, independent data.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Generalized ESD test is an extension of Grubbs' test that allows for the detection of multiple outliers. It computes test statistics for multiple points simultaneously, making it more powerful in datasets where several anomalies may exist. Like Grubbs' test, the ESD test also relies on the assumption of normality and uses the Student's t-distribution to determine significance thresholds.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Statistical methods for anomaly detection rely on several key assumptions, which influence their applicability and performance in real-world scenarios. The primary assumption is normalityâ€”that the data follows a normal distribution. This assumption simplifies the detection of anomalies because the properties of the normal distribution, such as symmetry and the empirical rule (which states that 99.7% of data lies within three standard deviations from the mean), are well understood. However, in many practical applications, real-world data often deviates from normality, exhibiting skewness, heavy tails, or multimodality. In such cases, using statistical methods based on normality assumptions may result in a high rate of false positives or missed anomalies.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Another critical assumption is independence. Many statistical tests, including Grubbs' and ESD, assume that the data points are independent of each other. However, in time-series data or data with spatial correlations, such as sensor measurements, this assumption is frequently violated. Anomalies in such datasets are often contextual or collective, making traditional statistical methods less effective.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Additionally, these methods typically assume that the dataset is homogeneous, meaning that all data points are drawn from the same underlying process. In heterogeneous datasets with subpopulations or varying distributions, it becomes difficult to apply statistical tests uniformly across the entire dataset. For instance, the z-score threshold of 3 may be appropriate for one subset of data but too lenient or too strict for another.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The limitations of statistical methods become evident when applied to complex datasets. For example, methods that rely on normality fail when the data exhibits significant deviations from a Gaussian distribution. Furthermore, real-world datasets often have high-dimensional features, and in such cases, computing simple univariate statistics like the z-score or Grubbs' test may not capture complex interactions between variables. Multivariate anomaly detection techniques, which account for correlations among features, are required in such cases.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To demonstrate the application of statistical methods for anomaly detection, we implement a few techniques in Rust. We begin with the z-score method and extend the discussion to more sophisticated tests like Grubbs' test and the Generalized ESD test. Our implementation will focus on datasets with different distributions to evaluate the effectiveness of these methods.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
For the Grubbs' test, we extend the Rust code to compute the test statistic for a single outlier:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use statrs::distribution::{StudentsT, ContinuousCDF};

fn grubbs_test(data: &[f64]) -> Option<usize> {
    let n = data.len();
    if n < 3 {
        // Grubbs' test requires at least 3 values
        return None;
    }

    let mean: f64 = data.iter().sum::<f64>() / n as f64;
    let variance: f64 = data.iter().map(|&x| (x - mean).powi(2)).sum::<f64>() / n as f64;
    let std_dev = variance.sqrt();

    // Corrected: remove the & from max_dev to match types
    let (max_dev_index, max_dev) = data.iter()
        .enumerate()
        .map(|(i, &x)| (i, (x - mean).abs()))
        .max_by(|(_, a), (_, b)| a.partial_cmp(b).unwrap())
        .unwrap();

    let grubbs_statistic = max_dev / std_dev;
    let critical_value = grubbs_critical_value(n, 0.05); // Critical value for alpha = 0.05

    if grubbs_statistic > critical_value {
        Some(max_dev_index)
    } else {
        None
    }
}

fn grubbs_critical_value(n: usize, alpha: f64) -> f64 {
    // Grubbs critical value formula approximation using Student's T distribution.
    // This is a simplified version for demonstration purposes.
    let t_dist = StudentsT::new(0.0, 1.0, (n as f64) - 2.0).unwrap();
    let t = t_dist.inverse_cdf(1.0 - alpha / (2.0 * n as f64));
    let numerator = (n as f64 - 1.0).sqrt() * t;
    let denominator = ((n as f64) - 2.0 + t.powi(2)).sqrt();
    numerator / denominator
}

fn main() {
    let data = vec![1.0, 2.0, 1.5, 1.8, 50.0, 2.1, 2.3]; // Example dataset
    match grubbs_test(&data) {
        Some(index) => println!("Anomaly detected at index: {}", index),
        None => println!("No anomalies detected"),
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This implementation computes the Grubbs' statistic and compares it to a critical value derived from the Student's t-distribution. If the test statistic exceeds the critical value, the point is flagged as an anomaly. The effectiveness of this test depends heavily on the normality of the data and the presence of a single outlier.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Finally, the Generalized ESD test can be implemented in a similar manner but with an iterative procedure that tests multiple potential outliers. This requires computing test statistics for various subsets of the dataset and comparing them to critical values at each step. While more complex, the Generalized ESD test is valuable for datasets where multiple outliers may exist.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
By applying these methods to datasets with varying distributions, we can evaluate their effectiveness in detecting anomalies. For example, on a normally distributed dataset, the z-score method may perform well, but when applied to a skewed distribution, it may fail to identify significant outliers. Similarly, Grubbs' test and ESD are powerful tools when data follows their underlying assumptions but struggle in real-world scenarios where distributions are often non-Gaussian or where data points exhibit correlations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In conclusion, statistical methods for anomaly detection provide a mathematically rigorous way to identify outliers in well-behaved datasets. However, their assumptions about normality, independence, and homogeneity limit their applicability to more complex, real-world datasets. Rust provides an efficient environment for implementing these methods, and through careful consideration of the datasetâ€™s properties, we can extend these techniques to a broader range of applications.
</p>

# 11.3. Machine Learning Approaches to Anomaly Detection
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Machine learning approaches to anomaly detection provide more flexible and adaptive methods for identifying anomalous data, especially in complex and high-dimensional datasets. These methods can be broadly classified into three categories: supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised. Each of these approaches is designed to handle different types of datasets and anomaly detection problems. Unlike traditional statistical methods, which rely on strong distributional assumptions, machine learning methods can capture more complex relationships between data points, making them highly effective in modern anomaly detection tasks.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the context of anomaly detection, machine learning methods can be categorized into supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised approaches.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Supervised methods require a labeled dataset where both normal and anomalous instances are identified. The goal of the algorithm is to learn a decision boundary or model that can distinguish between normal and anomalous data. Let $X = \{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n\}$ be a set of observations, where each $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is associated with a label $y_i \in \{0, 1\}$, where $1$ represents an anomaly and $0$ represents normal data. The task is to learn a mapping function $f: \mathbb{R}^d \to \{0, 1\}$, using models such as decision trees, random forests, or support vector machines (SVMs).
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Semi-supervised methods assume that the dataset contains only normal instances during training, and the task is to detect anomalies in the test data, which may include both normal and anomalous examples. This approach is suitable for many real-world scenarios where anomalies are rare and difficult to label. In semi-supervised learning, the model fff is trained on the normal data $X_{\text{train}}$, and during inference, the model identifies points that deviate from the learned distribution as anomalies.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Unsupervised methods are used when no labeled data is available. These methods aim to detect anomalies by identifying points that are significantly different from the majority of the data based on some learned model of normality. Common unsupervised approaches include clustering algorithms like k-means, density-based methods like DBSCAN, and specific anomaly detection algorithms like Isolation Forest and One-Class SVM.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Several key algorithms are widely used in machine learning for anomaly detection, including Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, and autoencoders. These methods each take a different approach to learning what constitutes normal versus anomalous data.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Isolation Forest algorithm is based on the idea that anomalies are easier to isolate from the rest of the data. In a tree-based structure, an anomaly is likely to be separated from normal data by fewer splits due to its distinct characteristics. Given a dataset $X$, the algorithm builds an ensemble of isolation trees, where each tree randomly partitions the feature space. The path length required to isolate a data point is an indicator of its "anomalousness." Formally, the anomaly score for a point xix_ixi is proportional to the average path length across the ensemble of trees. A shorter path indicates a higher likelihood that $x_i$ is an anomaly. The mathematical formulation for the anomaly score is:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$ s(x_i, n) = 2^{-\frac{E(h(x_i))}{c(n)}} $$
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
where $h(x_i)$ is the path length to isolate $x_i$, $E(h(x_i))$ is the expected path length, and $c(n)$ is a normalization factor.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The One-Class SVM is a kernel-based method that learns a decision boundary around the normal data in a high-dimensional feature space. Given a dataset $X = \{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n\}$, the One-Class SVM tries to find a hyperplane that maximizes the margin around the normal data, thereby separating it from potential anomalies. The objective is to minimize the following optimization function:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$ \min \frac{1}{2} \| w \|^2 + \frac{1}{\nu n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \max(0, 1 - f(x_i)), $$
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
where $f(x_i) = w^T \phi(x_i) - b$ is the decision function, Î½\\nuÎ½ controls the number of support vectors and outliers, and $\phi(x_i)$ is a kernel transformation. Points that lie outside the decision boundary are considered anomalies.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Autoencoders are neural network-based methods that learn a compressed representation of the input data in an unsupervised manner. The network consists of an encoder that maps the input data $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$ to a latent space representation $z \in \mathbb{R}^k$, and a decoder that reconstructs the input from the latent representation. The objective is to minimize the reconstruction error:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$L(x, \hat{x}) = \| x - \hat{x} \|^2$$
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
During training, the autoencoder learns to reconstruct normal data accurately. Anomalies are identified during inference when the reconstruction error exceeds a threshold, as anomalies are poorly reconstructed due to their divergence from normal patterns.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Each of these methods has strengths and weaknesses depending on the data. Isolation Forest is effective for high-dimensional and complex datasets but may struggle with subtle anomalies. One-Class SVM works well for data with clear boundaries between normal and anomalous instances but can be computationally expensive in large datasets. Autoencoders are powerful for detecting anomalies in structured or sequential data but require careful tuning of the network architecture and training parameters.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Now, let's explore how to implement these machine learning-based anomaly detection algorithms in Rust. Rust's performance and safety features make it an excellent choice for building robust machine learning applications. In our implementation, we will be using the <code>ndarray</code> crate for numerical computations and <code>linfa</code>, a machine learning framework in Rust, which provides a collection of algorithms for various tasks, including anomaly detection.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here is a sample implementation of the Isolation Forest algorithm using the <code>linfa</code> library:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use ndarray::Array2;

fn main() {
    // Sample dataset: Each row is a data point with two features
    let data = Array2::from_shape_vec((8, 2), vec![
        1.0, 2.0,
        1.5, 1.8,
        5.0, 8.0,
        6.0, 9.0,
        1.0, 0.6,
        9.0, 11.0,
        10.0, 12.0,
        50.0, 100.0, // Adding an obvious outlier
    ]).unwrap();

    let threshold = 1.5; // Threshold for identifying anomalies

    // Iterate over each row in the dataset
    for (i, row) in data.rows().into_iter().enumerate() {
        // Calculate mean manually
        let mean: f64 = row.sum() / row.len() as f64;

        // Calculate standard deviation manually
        let variance: f64 = row.mapv(|x| (x - mean).powi(2)).sum() / row.len() as f64;
        let std_dev = variance.sqrt();

        println!("Row {}: mean = {:.2}, std_dev = {:.2}", i, mean, std_dev);

        // Detect anomalies based on z-score
        for &value in row.iter() {
            let z_score = (value - mean) / std_dev;
            println!("Value = {}, z-score = {:.2}", value, z_score);
            if z_score.abs() > threshold {
                println!("Anomaly detected at data point {}: value = {}, z-score = {:.2}", i, value, z_score);
            }
        }
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, we define a small dataset that includes normal and anomalous points. We then create an <code>IsolationForest</code> model and fit it to the data. The model is subsequently used to predict anomalies, where the output indicates which data points are classified as normal or anomalous.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Next, we can implement the One-Class SVM using the <code>linfa</code> library. Here's how to do that:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use ndarray::{Array2, Axis};

fn main() {
    // Sample dataset with modified values to observe anomalies
    let data = Array2::from_shape_vec((8, 2), vec![
        1.0, 2.0,
        1.5, 1.8,
        5.0, 8.0,
        6.0, 9.0,
        1.0, 0.6,
        9.0, 11.0,
        10.0, 12.0,
        50.0, 100.0, // Adding an obvious outlier
    ]).unwrap();

    // Calculate median and median absolute deviation (MAD) for each feature
    let median = data.map_axis(Axis(0), |col| {
        let mut col_vec: Vec<f64> = col.to_vec();
        col_vec.sort_by(|a, b| a.partial_cmp(b).unwrap());
        let mid = col_vec.len() / 2;
        if col_vec.len() % 2 == 0 {
            (col_vec[mid - 1] + col_vec[mid]) / 2.0
        } else {
            col_vec[mid]
        }
    });

    let mad = data.map_axis(Axis(0), |col| {
        let med = median.to_vec();
        let med_value = med[0];
        let mad_vec: Vec<f64> = col.iter().map(|&x| (x - med_value).abs()).collect();
        let mut sorted_mad_vec = mad_vec.clone();
        sorted_mad_vec.sort_by(|a, b| a.partial_cmp(b).unwrap());
        let mid = sorted_mad_vec.len() / 2;
        if sorted_mad_vec.len() % 2 == 0 {
            (sorted_mad_vec[mid - 1] + sorted_mad_vec[mid]) / 2.0
        } else {
            sorted_mad_vec[mid]
        }
    });

    println!("Median: {:?}", median);
    println!("MAD: {:?}", mad);

    // Set threshold for anomaly detection
    let threshold = 2.0;

    // Detect anomalies based on MAD
    for (i, row) in data.outer_iter().enumerate() {
        let mut is_anomaly = false;
        for ((&value, &med), &mad_value) in row.iter().zip(median.iter()).zip(mad.iter()) {
            let mad_score = (value - med).abs() / mad_value;
            println!("Data point {}: value = {:.2}, median = {:.2}, mad = {:.2}, mad_score = {:.2}", i, value, med, mad_value, mad_score);
            if mad_score > threshold {
                is_anomaly = true;
                break;
            }
        }
        if is_anomaly {
            println!("Anomaly detected at data point {}: {:?}", i, row);
        }
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This code sample follows a similar structure as the previous one and shows how to set up a One-Class SVM model. The predictions indicate whether each data point is classified as normal or anomalous.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Finally, we can implement an autoencoder for anomaly detection. While the <code>linfa</code> library does not directly support autoencoders, we can utilize the <code>tch-rs</code> crate to work with the underlying PyTorch library to build and train a neural network model. Here is a simplified version of how you might structure the autoencoder:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use ndarray::{Array2, Axis};
use rand::prelude::*;
use rand_distr::Normal;

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Autoencoder {
    encoder_weights: Array2<f32>,
    decoder_weights: Array2<f32>,
}

impl Autoencoder {
    fn new(input_size: usize, encoding_size: usize) -> Autoencoder {
        let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
        let normal = Normal::new(0.0, 1.0).unwrap();

        // Initialize weights with random values using iterators and mapping
        let encoder_weights: Array2<f32> = Array2::from_shape_fn((input_size, encoding_size), |_| normal.sample(&mut rng));
        let decoder_weights: Array2<f32> = Array2::from_shape_fn((encoding_size, input_size), |_| normal.sample(&mut rng));

        Autoencoder { encoder_weights, decoder_weights }
    }

    fn forward(&self, x: &Array2<f32>) -> Array2<f32> {
        let encoded = x.dot(&self.encoder_weights).mapv(|v| 1.0 / (1.0 + (-v).exp())); // Sigmoid activation
        encoded.dot(&self.decoder_weights)
    }

    fn train(&mut self, data: &Array2<f32>, learning_rate: f32, epochs: usize) {
        for epoch in 0..epochs {
            let output = self.forward(data);
            let error = &output - data;
            let loss = error.mapv(|e| e * e).mean().unwrap();

            // Backpropagation (simplified for demonstration purposes)
            let grad_output = &error * 2.0;
            let grad_decoder = grad_output.t().dot(data); // Corrected matrix multiplication dimensions
            let grad_encoder = data.t().dot(&grad_output); // Corrected matrix multiplication dimensions

            self.decoder_weights = &self.decoder_weights - &(grad_decoder * learning_rate);
            self.encoder_weights = &self.encoder_weights - &(grad_encoder * learning_rate);

            if epoch % 100 == 0 {
                println!("Epoch {}: loss = {:.4}", epoch, loss);
            }
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    // Sample dataset
    let data = Array2::from_shape_vec((8, 2), vec![
        1.0, 2.0,
        1.5, 1.8,
        5.0, 8.0,
        6.0, 9.0,
        1.0, 0.6,
        9.0, 11.0,
        10.0, 12.0,
        10.0, 2.0,
    ]).unwrap();

    let mut autoencoder = Autoencoder::new(2, 2); // Increased encoding size to 2
    autoencoder.train(&data, 0.001, 2000); // Reduced learning rate and increased epochs

    // In practice, you would compute reconstruction errors to detect anomalies
    let reconstructed = autoencoder.forward(&data);
    let reconstruction_error = (&data - &reconstructed).mapv(|v| v * v).sum_axis(Axis(1));
    println!("Reconstruction errors: {:?}", reconstruction_error);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this code, we define a simple autoencoder with an encoder and decoder, where the model is trained on a dataset. After training, you would typically calculate the reconstruction loss for each input to identify anomalies.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In conclusion, machine learning methods for anomaly detection provide robust tools for identifying outliers in various datasets. By understanding the fundamental ideas behind supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised approaches, as well as implementing algorithms like Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, and autoencoders in Rust, we can effectively tackle the challenge of detecting anomalies in data. As we continue to explore these methods, it becomes evident that Rust offers a powerful environment for building efficient and safe machine learning applications.

# 11.4. Density-Based Anomaly Detection
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Density-based anomaly detection methods focus on identifying data points that are isolated or reside in regions of low-density relative to their neighbors. This approach contrasts with methods that rely on global characteristics like mean and variance, as density-based methods assess local properties of the data. Two of the most well-known algorithms in this category are Local Outlier Factor (LOF) and DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise). Both methods exploit the idea that normal data points belong to dense regions, while anomalies appear in sparse regions of the feature space.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Local Outlier Factor (LOF) is a method that identifies anomalies by comparing the local density of a point to that of its neighbors. The local density is defined using the concept of the k-distance neighborhood, which is the distance from a point to its k-th nearest neighbor. Let $X = \{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n\}$ be a dataset of points in $\mathbb{R}^d$. The reachability distance from point $x_i$ to a point $x_j$ is defined as:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$ \text{reachability\_dist}(x_i, x_j) = \max(k\text{-distance}(x_j), \|x_i - x_j\|) $$
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The local reachability density of $x_i$ is the inverse of the average reachability distance from $x_i$ to its k-nearest neighbors:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$ \text{lrd}(x_i) = \left( \frac{1}{|N_k(x_i)|} \sum_{x_j \in N_k(x_i)} \text{reachability\_dist}(x_i, x_j) \right)^{-1} $$
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The LOF score for a point $x_i$ is then defined as the ratio of the average local reachability density of its neighbors to its own local reachability density:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$ \text{LOF}(x_i) = \frac{1}{|N_k(x_i)|} \sum_{x_j \in N_k(x_i)} \frac{\text{lrd}(x_j)}{\text{lrd}(x_i)} $$
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
A LOF score close to 1 indicates that the point has a similar density to its neighbors, while a score significantly greater than 1 suggests that the point is in a lower density region and is thus an anomaly.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
DBSCAN, on the other hand, is a density-based clustering algorithm that also identifies outliers as points that do not belong to any dense cluster. DBSCAN defines clusters as regions of high density separated by regions of lower density. For each point xix_ixi, the algorithm defines a neighborhood as the set of points within a radius $\epsilon$. A point is considered a core point if its neighborhood contains at least minPtsminPtsminPts points, meaning the density in that region is high enough to form a cluster. If a point does not meet this criterion and is not reachable from any core point, it is classified as an outlier.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Given a dataset $X$, DBSCAN identifies core points and forms clusters by expanding each core point's neighborhood. Points that cannot be assigned to any cluster are labeled as anomalies (or noise points). The effectiveness of DBSCAN depends heavily on the choice of $\epsilon$ and $minPts$, which control the sensitivity of the algorithm to local densities.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The primary strength of density-based methods like LOF and DBSCAN is their ability to capture local density variations. In contrast to global methods that assume uniform behavior across the entire dataset, density-based approaches assess the relative density of a point compared to its neighbors. This local perspective makes these methods particularly well-suited for datasets where anomalies may not appear as extreme outliers globally but can be identified as sparse points in localized regions.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In LOF, the comparison of a pointâ€™s density with that of its neighbors allows the detection of subtle anomalies that may not be evident when considering global metrics such as distance to a centroid. For example, a point that lies in a sparse region of a high-density cluster may not be a global outlier but can still be considered anomalous within its local context.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Similarly, DBSCANâ€™s ability to cluster data based on local density makes it highly effective in datasets where clusters of varying shapes and sizes exist. The methodâ€™s reliance on a fixed radius $\epsilon$ and minimum number of points $minPts$ to define clusters provides flexibility, allowing it to capture clusters in non-convex shapes. However, DBSCANâ€™s reliance on fixed parameters can also be a limitation in datasets with varying densities, as the algorithm may fail to detect clusters in regions of different scales. Points in low-density regions that should be considered part of a cluster may be mistakenly labeled as anomalies if $\epsilon$ is set too small.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Another limitation of these methods is their sensitivity to the curse of dimensionality. As the number of dimensions increases, the concept of density becomes less meaningful because points tend to be more uniformly distributed in high-dimensional spaces. In such cases, the distances between points converge, making it difficult to distinguish between dense and sparse regions. Therefore, in high-dimensional datasets, preprocessing techniques like dimensionality reduction may be necessary before applying density-based anomaly detection.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In practical applications, we can implement both LOF and DBSCAN in Rust to perform anomaly detection. For this purpose, we can utilize the <code>ndarray</code> crate, which provide necessary functionalities for numerical operations and clustering algorithms respectively. Below, we provide a sample implementation for each algorithm.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
First, we will implement the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm. The following Rust code demonstrates how to compute the LOF scores for a dataset:
</p>

            .map(|j| {
                let dist = (data.row(i).to_owned() - data.row(j).to_owned()).mapv(|x| x.powi(2)).sum();
                (j, dist.sqrt())
            })

            .collect();

        println!("Point {}: Neighbors = {:?}", i, neighbors);

        let lrd = 1.0 / (neighbors.iter()
            .map(|&j| distances.iter().find(|&&(idx, _)| idx == j).unwrap().1)
            .sum::<f64>() / k as f64);

        println!("Point {}: Local Reachability Density (LRD) = {:.4}", i, lrd);

        for &j in &neighbors {

            reach_distances[i][j] = reach_distance.max(lrd);
        }
    }

    for i in 0..data.nrows() {
        let sum_reach_distance: f64 = reach_distances[i].iter().sum();
        lof_scores[i] = reach_distances[i].iter()

    let k = 3; // Increased k-value for better anomaly detection
    let lof_scores = compute_lof(&data, k);
    println!("LOF Scores: {:?}", lof_scores);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this implementation, we define a function <code>compute_lof</code> that computes the LOF scores given a dataset and a parameter <code>k</code>, which represents the number of nearest neighbors to consider. The function calculates distances between points, determines local reachability distances, and computes the final LOF scores.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Next, we can implement the DBSCAN algorithm, which clusters data points based on density. The following Rust code illustrates how to apply DBSCAN for anomaly detection:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use ndarray::{Array2};

fn dbscan(data: &Array2<f64>, eps: f64, min_pts: usize) -> Vec<Option<usize>> {
    let mut labels = vec![None; data.nrows()];
    let mut cluster_id = 0;

    for i in 0..data.nrows() {
        if labels[i].is_some() {
            continue;
        }

        let neighbors = region_query(data, i, eps);
        if neighbors.len() < min_pts {
            labels[i] = Some(0); // Mark as noise
            continue;
        }

        cluster_id += 1;
        labels[i] = Some(cluster_id);
        let mut seeds = neighbors.clone();

        while !seeds.is_empty() {
            let current = seeds.pop().unwrap();
            if labels[current].is_none() {
                labels[current] = Some(cluster_id);

                if current_neighbors.len() >= min_pts {
                    seeds.extend(current_neighbors);
                }
            }

    labels
}

fn region_query(data: &Array2<f64>, point_index: usize, eps: f64) -> Vec<usize> {
    let mut neighbors = Vec::new();
    let point = data.row(point_index).to_owned();

    for i in 0..data.nrows() {

            let dist = (point.clone() - data.row(i).to_owned()).mapv(|x| x.powi(2)).sum().sqrt();
            if dist <= eps {

    }
    neighbors
}

    let eps = 1.5;
    let min_pts = 2;
    let labels = dbscan(&data, eps, min_pts);
    println!("DBSCAN Cluster Labels: {:?}", labels);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this DBSCAN implementation, we define the <code>dbscan</code> function which assigns cluster labels to the data points based on the specified <code>eps</code> (the radius of neighborhood) and <code>min_pts</code> (the minimum number of points required to form a dense region). The <code>region_query</code> function identifies neighboring points within the defined <code>eps</code>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In conclusion, density-based anomaly detection methods like LOF and DBSCAN provide robust frameworks for identifying anomalies in datasets characterized by varying densities. By leveraging local density measures, these techniques can effectively distinguish between normal and anomalous points, making them valuable tools in data analysis. The Rust implementations provided in this section serve as a practical guide for applying these concepts to real-world datasets, showcasing both their strengths and challenges in different data scenarios. The choice of algorithm and its parameters should be guided by the specific characteristics of the data at hand, ensuring effective anomaly detection in a variety of contexts.

# 11.5. Time-Series Anomaly Detection
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Time-series anomaly detection is a crucial area in machine learning where the goal is to identify unusual patterns or outliers in data that evolves over time. These anomalies can represent sudden changes, rare events, or disruptions in the usual trend of a system, such as stock price fluctuations, machine sensor data anomalies, or unexpected demand spikes in e-commerce platforms. Time-series data presents unique challenges due to its temporal structure, where the order of data points carries critical information.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Anomaly detection in time-series data involves finding points or segments where the behavior of the series deviates from an expected pattern. Formally, consider a time-series dataset $X = \{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n\}$, where $x_i \in \mathbb{R}$ represents an observation at time $t_i$. The task is to identify a subset $A \subset X$, where each $x_i \in A$ deviates from the expected value based on the historical pattern of the time-series. Anomalies in time-series data can take several forms, including point anomalies, where individual data points are abnormal, and collective anomalies, where a sequence of values represents an unusual pattern.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Three common methods for detecting anomalies in time-series data are the moving average, ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average), and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. Each of these methods captures different aspects of the time-series structure to model normal behavior and detect deviations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The moving average method is a simple and effective technique for anomaly detection. It smooths the time-series data by averaging a fixed window of past observations and comparing the current value to the smoothed trend. Formally, given a time-series $X$, the moving average at time ttt, denoted $MA_t$, for a window size www, is calculated as:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$ MA_t = \frac{1}{w} \sum_{i=t-w+1}^{t} x_i $$
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
An anomaly is detected if the difference between the actual value $x_t$ and the moving average $MA_t$ exceeds a predefined threshold $\delta$, i.e.,
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$ |x_t - MA_t| > \delta $$
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The moving average method works well for detecting point anomalies in relatively stable time-series but may struggle with complex patterns or seasonality.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) is a more sophisticated statistical method for modeling time-series data, capturing both the autoregressive (AR) nature of the series and its moving average (MA) components. ARIMA can handle both stationary and non-stationary data by applying differencing to the series to remove trends. An ARIMA model is typically represented as ARIMA(p, d, q), where ppp is the number of autoregressive terms, ddd is the order of differencing, and qqq is the number of moving average terms.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The general form of an ARIMA model for a time-series $X$ is:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$ x_t = c + \sum_{i=1}^{p} \phi_i x_{t-i} + \sum_{j=1}^{q} \theta_j \epsilon_{t-j} + \epsilon_txtâ€‹=c+i=1âˆ‘pâ€‹Ï•iâ€‹ $$
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
where $\phi_i$ are the autoregressive coefficients, $\theta_j$ are the moving average coefficients, ccc is a constant, and $\epsilon_t$ is the error term (white noise).
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
ARIMA is useful for detecting anomalies in time-series data with trends and seasonality, as it models both short-term dependencies and noise. After fitting an ARIMA model, anomalies can be detected by analyzing the residuals (differences between the actual and predicted values). If the residuals exceed a certain threshold, they indicate an anomaly.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks are deep learning models designed to handle sequential data and capture long-term dependencies. Unlike traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, LSTMs use memory cells and gating mechanisms to retain important information over long periods of time. The key to LSTM-based anomaly detection is its ability to predict the next value in a time-series based on historical data.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Given a time-series $X$, an LSTM network learns to predict the value $\hat{x}_t$ at time $t$ based on previous observations $\{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{t-1}\}$. An anomaly is detected when the prediction error $|x_t - \hat{x}_t|$ exceeds a predefined threshold. Mathematically, the LSTM-based prediction can be expressed as:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$\hat{x}_t = f(\{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{t-1}\})$$
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
where $f$ is the function learned by the LSTM network during training. LSTMs are particularly effective in complex, nonlinear time-series where relationships between data points span long time intervals.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In order to implement time-series anomaly detection in Rust, we can take advantage of existing libraries for data manipulation and machine learning. For instance, we can utilize <code>ndarray</code> for numerical computations and <code>linfa</code> for machine learning tasks. Let's consider an example where we detect anomalies in stock prices. First, we will simulate a time-series dataset representing stock prices over a period of time, and then we will apply the moving average method to identify anomalies.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
First, make sure to add the necessary dependencies in your <code>Cargo.toml</code>:
</p>

{{< prism lang="toml" line-numbers="true">}}
[dependencies]
ndarray = "0.15.3"
linfa = "0.4.0"
linfa-trees = "0.4.0"
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
We can start by simulating stock price data:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use ndarray::{Array1, Array2};
use rand::Rng;

fn generate_stock_prices(size: usize) -> Array1<f64> {
    let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
    let mut prices = Array1::zeros(size);
    prices[0] = 100.0; // Starting price
    for i in 1..size {
        let change: f64 = rng.gen_range(-1.0..1.0); // Random price change
        prices[i] = prices[i - 1] + change;
    }
    prices
}

fn main() {
    let stock_prices = generate_stock_prices(100);
    println!("{:?}", stock_prices);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this code snippet, we generate a synthetic time-series dataset representing stock prices. Next, we can implement the moving average method to detect anomalies:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn moving_average(prices: &Array1<f64>, window_size: usize) -> Array1<f64> {
    let mut averages = Array1::zeros(prices.len());
    for i in 0..prices.len() {
        let start = if i < window_size { 0 } else { i - window_size + 1 };
        let end = i + 1;
        averages[i] = prices.slice(s![start..end]).mean().unwrap();
    }
    averages
}

fn detect_anomalies(prices: &Array1<f64>, moving_avg: &Array1<f64>, threshold: f64) -> Vec<usize> {
    let mut anomalies = Vec::new();
    for i in 0..prices.len() {
        if (prices[i] - moving_avg[i]).abs() > threshold {
            anomalies.push(i);
        }
    }
    anomalies
}

fn main() {
    let stock_prices = generate_stock_prices(100);
    let moving_avg = moving_average(&stock_prices, 5);
    let anomalies = detect_anomalies(&stock_prices, &moving_avg, 3.0);

    println!("Detected anomalies at indices: {:?}", anomalies);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this implementation, we calculate the moving average for a defined window size and then identify anomalies by comparing the actual stock prices against the moving average, using a specified threshold. If the difference exceeds the threshold, it is flagged as an anomaly.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Moreover, for a more sophisticated approach, if we want to implement an LSTM-based anomaly detection, we would typically need a neural network library such as <code>tch-rs</code>, which provides bindings to PyTorch. LSTM implementation in Rust requires a deeper understanding of tensor operations, model training, and hyperparameter tuning, which could be a more complex endeavor.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Finally, visualizing the detected anomalies can significantly enhance our understanding of the data. While Rust does not have as many visualization libraries as Python, we can utilize libraries like <code>plotters</code> to visualize our time-series data along with the detected anomalies.
</p>

{{< prism lang="toml">}}
[dependencies]
plotters = "0.3.0"
{{< /prism >}}
{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use plotters::prelude::*;

fn plot_anomalies(prices: &Array1<f64>, anomalies: &[usize]) {
    let root = BitMapBackend::new("anomalies.png", (640, 480)).into_drawing_area();
    root.fill(&WHITE).unwrap();
    
    let mut chart = ChartBuilder::on(&root)
        .margin(5)
        .caption("Stock Prices with Anomalies", ("sans-serif", 50).into_font())
        .x_label_area_size(30)
        .y_label_area_size(30)
        .build_cartesian_2d(0..prices.len(), prices.min().unwrap()..prices.max().unwrap())
        .unwrap();

    chart.configure_series_labels().border_style(&BLACK).draw().unwrap();

    chart.draw_series(LineSeries::new((0..prices.len()).map(|i| (i, prices[i])), &BLUE)).unwrap();

    for &anomaly in anomalies {
        chart.draw_series(PointSeries::of_element(vec![(anomaly, prices[anomaly])], 5, &RED, ShapeType::Circle)).unwrap();
    }

    root.present().unwrap();
}

fn main() {
    let stock_prices = generate_stock_prices(100);
    let moving_avg = moving_average(&stock_prices, 5);
    let anomalies = detect_anomalies(&stock_prices, &moving_avg, 3.0);
    
    plot_anomalies(&stock_prices, &anomalies);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this code, we define a function to plot the stock prices and the detected anomalies. The resulting image will provide a visual representation of the data, making it easier to interpret the anomalies in the context of the overall trend.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In conclusion, time-series anomaly detection in Rust can be approached using various methodologies ranging from simple moving averages to complex LSTM models. By leveraging Rust's performance and safety features, we can effectively analyze and visualize time-series data, gaining valuable insights into patterns that deviate from the norm. As the field of machine learning continues to evolve, Rust provides a robust environment for developing high-performance applications in anomaly detection and beyond.

# 11.6. Evaluating Anomaly Detection Models
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Evaluating anomaly detection models is a critical step in understanding their effectiveness, as detecting anomalies typically involves dealing with highly imbalanced datasets where anomalies represent a very small fraction of the total data. The rarity of anomalies introduces challenges in assessing model performance, as traditional evaluation metrics may not adequately capture the nuances of false positives, false negatives, and the modelâ€™s ability to generalize to unseen data. In this section, we explore key evaluation metrics for anomaly detection models, discuss their mathematical foundations, and implement them in Rust for practical application.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The evaluation of anomaly detection models requires specialized metrics that take into account the imbalanced nature of the data. In anomaly detection, the primary goal is to correctly identify anomalous instances (true positives) while minimizing the number of normal instances that are incorrectly classified as anomalies (false positives). However, since anomalies are rare, the typical accuracy metric, which measures the proportion of correct predictions over all predictions, can be misleading. For instance, a model that always predicts "normal" can achieve high accuracy if anomalies are rare but would fail at the actual task of identifying anomalies.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Key metrics used in evaluating anomaly detection models include precision, recall, F1 score, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, and the Area Under the Curve (AUC). These metrics provide a more comprehensive understanding of how well the model balances between detecting true anomalies and avoiding false positives.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The precision metric measures the proportion of correctly identified anomalies (true positives) out of all instances predicted as anomalies (true positives + false positives). Mathematically, it is defined as:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$ \text{Precision} = \frac{TP}{TP + FP} $$
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
where $TP$ represents true positives and $FP$ represents false positives. Precision is a measure of the model's accuracy when it makes a positive prediction, and high precision indicates that the model is good at avoiding false positives.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The recall metric, also known as the true positive rate or sensitivity, measures the proportion of true anomalies that are correctly identified by the model out of all actual anomalies (true positives + false negatives). It is given by:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$ \text{Recall} = \frac{TP}{TP + FN} $$
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
where $FN$ represents false negatives. Recall captures the model's ability to identify all true anomalies, and high recall means the model is less likely to miss anomalies.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced metric that takes both false positives and false negatives into account. It is particularly useful when the dataset is highly imbalanced, as is often the case in anomaly detection. The F1 score is defined as:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$ F1 = 2 \times \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}} $$
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
A high F1 score indicates that the model achieves a good balance between precision and recall.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is a graphical representation of the trade-offs between true positive rate (recall) and false positive rate. The false positive rate (FPR) is defined as:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$ \text{FPR} = \frac{FP}{FP + TN} $$
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
where $TN$ represents true negatives. The ROC curve plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate for different classification thresholds, giving a visual indication of the model's performance at various levels of strictness in identifying anomalies. A model with perfect anomaly detection would have an ROC curve that passes through the top-left corner, indicating a high true positive rate and a low false positive rate.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Area Under the Curve (AUC) summarizes the ROC curve into a single value. It measures the likelihood that the model ranks a randomly chosen anomalous instance higher than a randomly chosen normal instance. The AUC is a number between 0 and 1, where an AUC of 1 represents perfect anomaly detection, and an AUC of 0.5 indicates that the model is no better than random guessing.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To implement these evaluation metrics in Rust, we can create functions that compute precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC. Below is a Rust implementation that demonstrates how to evaluate an anomaly detection model using these metrics. In this example, we will simulate a simple scenario where we have the true labels and predicted labels of a dataset.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn precision(true_positives: u32, false_positives: u32) -> f64 {
    if true_positives + false_positives == 0 {
        return 0.0;
    }
    true_positives as f64 / (true_positives + false_positives) as f64
}

fn recall(true_positives: u32, false_negatives: u32) -> f64 {
    if true_positives + false_negatives == 0 {
        return 0.0;
    }
    true_positives as f64 / (true_positives + false_negatives) as f64
}

fn f1_score(precision: f64, recall: f64) -> f64 {
    if precision + recall == 0.0 {
        return 0.0;
    }
    2.0 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall)
}

fn main() {
    let true_positives = 30;
    let false_positives = 10;
    let false_negatives = 5;

    let prec = precision(true_positives, false_positives);
    let rec = recall(true_positives, false_negatives);
    let f1 = f1_score(prec, rec);

    println!("Precision: {:.2}", prec);
    println!("Recall: {:.2}", rec);
    println!("F1 Score: {:.2}", f1);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the <code>precision</code>, <code>recall</code>, and <code>f1_score</code> functions compute their respective metrics based on the input of true positives, false positives, and false negatives. The <code>main</code> function simulates a scenario with specific counts of correct and incorrect predictions, calculates the evaluation metrics, and prints the results. This implementation allows us to assess the performance of various anomaly detection models by comparing their evaluation metrics.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Next, to evaluate multiple models, we can extend our approach by simulating predictions from different anomaly detection algorithms and calculating their evaluation metrics. Suppose we have two models, Model A and Model B, with the following true positive, false positive, and false negative counts:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn evaluate_models() {
    let models = [
        ("Model A", 30, 10, 5),
        ("Model B", 25, 15, 2),
    ];

    for (name, tp, fp, fn_) in models.iter() {
        let prec = precision(*tp, *fp);
        let rec = recall(*tp, *fn_);
        let f1 = f1_score(prec, rec);
        println!("{}: Precision: {:.2}, Recall: {:.2}, F1 Score: {:.2}", name, prec, rec, f1);
    }
}

fn main() {
    evaluate_models();
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this extended example, we define an array of tuples containing the model names and their corresponding counts of true positives, false positives, and false negatives. The <code>evaluate_models</code> function iterates through this array, computes the evaluation metrics for each model, and prints the results. By comparing the outputs, we can determine which model performs better based on the chosen metrics.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Overall, evaluating anomaly detection models requires a thoughtful approach to selecting the appropriate metrics and understanding the nuances of the performance trade-offs involved. By implementing these metrics in Rust and applying them to various models, we can gain valuable insights into their effectiveness and make informed decisions about model selection and tuning in the context of anomaly detection.
</p>

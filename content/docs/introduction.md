This book, <em>Machine Learning via Rust (MLVR)</em>, is a product of the teaching efforts at the Data Science Center (DSC) of the University of Indonesia. Our goal is to equip students with the best tools available for both the training and deployment of machine learning models, ensuring they are prepared for the challenges of the evolving technological landscape.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In our classroom teachings, we have chosen to complement Python with Rust as the primary language for this book. Rust offers a unique set of advantages, including flexibility in hardware adaptation, robust support for parallelism and concurrency, and the ability to explore the horizons of high-performance computing. These qualities make Rust an invaluable addition to our curriculum, allowing students to push the boundaries of what is possible in machine learning.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Moreover, Rust's potential as a language for quantum computing and simulation positions it at the forefront of future computational advancements. By introducing Rust alongside Python, we are preparing our students not just for today's demands, but also for the cutting-edge developments of tomorrow.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The RantAI team has played a crucial role in transforming the teaching materials used in the DSC into this comprehensive book. The content of <em>MLVR</em> reflects the fundamental, conceptual, and practical domains of machine learning, providing a holistic approach to the subject.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
I encourage you to explore and exploit this book with an open mind. My hope is that you will find joy in your journey to becoming a scientist and engineer, equipped with the knowledge and tools necessary to excel in this exciting field.

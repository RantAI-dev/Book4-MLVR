<em>Part II of "Machine Learning via Rust (MLVR)"</em> dives deep into the world of supervised learning, one of the most prevalent and powerful approaches in the field of machine learning. This section methodically explores the core algorithms that form the backbone of predictive modeling, starting with linear models, which provide the foundational understanding of how to establish relationships between input features and outputs. It then progresses to decision trees and ensemble methods, offering a robust toolkit for capturing complex patterns and reducing variance in model predictions. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are introduced next, showcasing their ability to handle both linear and non-linear classification problems with high accuracy. Finally, the section culminates with neural networks and backpropagation, delving into the architecture and training processes that power some of the most advanced and effective machine learning models today. Each chapter not only explains the theoretical underpinnings of these algorithms but also provides practical, hands-on guidance for implementing them efficiently in Rust, enabling readers to build, train, and evaluate models that learn from labeled data to make precise predictions.

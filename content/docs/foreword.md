<strong>"<em>Machine learning is a powerful tool for uncovering hidden patterns and driving decision-making, but its true potential is realized when combined with robust and efficient coding practices.</em>" â€” Yann LeCun</strong>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The de facto standard for machine learning engineering today is Python, a language beloved for its simplicity and extensive libraries. However, in writing this book, <em>Machine Learning via Rust (MLVR)</em>, we made a deliberate choice to use Rust as the primary language. Rust, with its low-level nature, offers unique flexibilities that allow for deeper hardware adaptation, making it an ideal choice for those who wish to explore the frontiers of machine learning.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
My journey in machine learning began from a background steeped in mathematics and physics, disciplines that provided me with a strong theoretical foundation. I have come to realize that in the era of Generative AI (GenAI), implementing machine learning models can seem trivialâ€”provided you know what to code. GenAI is a remarkable tool, one that accelerates the coding process and opens doors to possibilities that were previously unimaginable.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
For students embarking on this journey, it is crucial to remember that machine learning is fundamentally about mathematical models. The first step is to deeply understand the underlying mathematics. Only then can you unlock the full potential of implementing these models across diverse hardware platforms. Rust, with its performance-oriented and system-level capabilities, stands out as the best choice for this task.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Learning machine learning should not be about quick wins or surface-level understanding. The classic "Hello World" programs are merely educational toolsâ€”they provide a foundation, but real-world development demands far more. When faced with the complexities of production, you need the best tools at your disposal. Rust is that tool, offering the power and precision required to bring sophisticated models to life.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
I encourage you to fight for understanding rather than simply memorizing concepts. Use GenAI as a productivity tool, one that can make you ten times faster than the average engineer, but remember that true mastery comes from deep comprehension.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Learning to understand takes time. Enjoy the journey. Thereâ€™s no need to rush through this book. Take your time, delve deep, and allow the <em>MLVR</em> book to guide you through a slow, profound learning process. The depth of knowledge you gain will be well worth the time invested.

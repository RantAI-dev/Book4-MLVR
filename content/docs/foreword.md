<p style="text-align: justify;">
The de facto standard for machine learning engineering today is Python, a language beloved for its simplicity and extensive libraries. However, in writing this book, <em>Machine Learning via Rust (MLVR)</em>, we made a deliberate choice to use Rust as the primary language. Rust, with its low-level nature, offers unique flexibilities that allow for deeper hardware adaptation, making it an ideal choice for those who wish to explore the frontiers of machine learning.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
My journey in machine learning began from a background steeped in mathematics and physics, disciplines that provided me with a strong theoretical foundation. I have come to realize that in the era of Generative AI (GenAI), implementing machine learning models can seem trivialâ€”provided you know what to code. GenAI is a remarkable tool, one that accelerates the coding process and opens doors to possibilities that were previously unimaginable.
</p>

- **Mathematical Models:** Understanding the underlying mathematics is the foundation of machine learning. Rust's strong typing and performance allow these models to be implemented efficiently across hardware platforms.
- **Optimizing Performance:** Rustâ€™s low-level capabilities provide fine control over hardware resources, making it ideal for optimizing the performance of machine learning models, from deep learning to reinforcement learning.
- **Concurrency and Parallelism:** Rust's system-level design, with features like ownership and borrowing, allows for safe concurrency and parallelismâ€”critical components when scaling machine learning models.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Machine learning should not be about quick wins or surface-level understanding. While "Hello World" programs provide a foundation, real-world development demands more. In production, you need the best tools at your disposalâ€”Rust provides the power and precision required to bring sophisticated models to life. Use GenAI to boost productivity, but remember that true mastery comes from deep comprehension.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
RantAIâ€™s dedication to *advancing scientific computation* through Rust reflects our commitment to pushing boundaries. Rust's performance and safety-first design make it a perfect fit for machine learning, and this book stands as a testament to that vision. MLVR is not just an educational resourceâ€”it is a guide to unlocking new potentials in this dynamic field.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Enjoy the journey through this book, and take the time to delve deep. With patience and focus, the insights you gain will make you a better engineer and innovator.
